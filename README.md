**Student Performance Analysis**
This repository contains Python code and findings for an exploratory data analysis on student performance data. The study investigates how various factors - parental education, test preparation courses, type of lunch, gender, and race/ethnicity - affect student scores.

**Project Objective**

The main aim of this project is to identify significant factors that contribute to a student's academic performance and provide insights that could help educational institutions enhance learning outcomes.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is StudentsPerformance.csv. It contains student scores and various other demographic and school-related information.

**Research Questions**

This project primarily addresses the following research questions:

What is the relationship between the parental level of education and student's average scores across all subjects?

Do students who complete the test preparation course have better average scores than those who do not?

How does the type of lunch (standard vs free/reduced) affect the average student scores?

Are there differences in average student scores based on gender?

Does race/ethnicity have an impact on student scores across all subjects?

**Files in this Repository**

main.py - Jupyter notebook containing Python code for the analysis

StudentsPerformance.csv - Dataset file

StudentsPerformanceFindings.PDF - A markdown file with the findings and implications of the study

**How to Run**

To run the Jupyter notebook, you will need a Python environment with necessary libraries (such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy) installed. You can open and run the notebook cell by cell to follow along the analysis.

**Results**

The findings from this study offer valuable insights for educational institutions, suggesting the importance of various factors in influencing student scores.

Please see StudentsPerformanceFindings.PDF for a detailed summary of the findings and their potential implications.
